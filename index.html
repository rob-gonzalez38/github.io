        <p>My name is Rob, I am a student at Boise State University and this is my webpage I made for my CS100 course.
          In this webpage you will find links to my "About Me" where I provide a little more insight to who I am. 
          You will also see my "The Road So Far" where I briefly walk you through my journey after high school. 
          Finally, you can see my "Hobbies" page which is pretty self-explanatory.
